# SARSA Agent Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

Your traffic light control project now includes a **complete SARSA agent implementation** with the following features:

### 🧠 SARSA Agent (`src/environment/sarsa_agent.py`)

#### Standard SARSA Agent
- **On-policy temporal difference learning** using the SARSA algorithm
- **State discretization** for continuous traffic states (queue lengths, phases, timing)
- **Epsilon-greedy exploration** with configurable decay
- **Multi-intersection control** (3 intersections, 4 phases each)
- **Q-table persistence** (save/load functionality)
- **Comprehensive statistics** tracking

#### Adaptive SARSA Agent  
- **Performance monitoring** over recent episodes
- **Dynamic parameter adjustment** (learning rate and exploration)
- **Automatic adaptation** when performance stagnates
- **Better handling** of changing traffic patterns

### 🎯 Key Features

1. **State Representation** (27 dimensions):
   - Queue lengths on 4 lanes per intersection (discretized into bins)
   - Current phase encoding (one-hot)
   - Time since last phase change (discretized)

2. **Action Space** (4^3 = 64 combinations):
   - 4 possible phases per intersection
   - Simultaneous control of all 3 intersections

3. **Reward Function**:
   - Minimizes total queue lengths across all intersections
   - Penalties for frequent phase changes
   - Encourages stable, efficient traffic flow

4. **Learning Algorithm**:
   - SARSA: Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γQ(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
   - On-policy learning (safer than Q-learning)
   - Conservative behavior suitable for traffic control

### 🚀 Training and Evaluation

#### Training Scripts
- **`examples/sarsa_training.py`**: Complete training pipeline with SUMO integration
- **`test_sarsa_agent.py`**: Standalone testing without SUMO requirements
- **`evaluate_sarsa.py`**: Performance evaluation on different traffic scenarios

#### Training Features
- Progress monitoring with reward tracking
- Performance visualization
- Agent comparison capabilities
- Model persistence and loading

### 📊 Performance Metrics

The implementation tracks:
- **Episode rewards** and moving averages
- **Queue lengths** over time
- **Phase change frequency**
- **Exploration vs exploitation ratio**
- **Q-table size and coverage**

### 🔧 Integration with SUMO

The SARSA agent is fully integrated with your SUMO environment:
- **TrafficEnvironment** compatibility (Gymnasium interface)
- **Real-time state extraction** from SUMO simulation
- **Action application** to traffic lights via TraCI
- **Reward calculation** based on actual traffic conditions

### 📁 File Structure

```
src/environment/sarsa_agent.py      # Core SARSA implementation
examples/sarsa_training.py          # SUMO-integrated training
test_sarsa_agent.py                 # Standalone testing
evaluate_sarsa.py                   # Performance evaluation
sarsa_training_results.png          # Training visualization
```

### 🎮 Usage Examples

#### Basic Training
```python
from environment.sarsa_agent import SarsaAgent

agent = SarsaAgent(state_size=27, action_size=4)
action = agent.get_action(state)
agent.update(reward, next_state, next_action, done)
```

#### Adaptive Training
```python
from environment.sarsa_agent import AdaptiveSarsaAgent

agent = AdaptiveSarsaAgent(state_size=27, action_size=4)
# Automatically adapts learning parameters
agent.adapt_parameters(episode_reward)
```

### 🏆 Advantages for Traffic Control

1. **Safety**: On-policy learning ensures conservative, safe behavior
2. **Stability**: Reduces aggressive phase switching
3. **Scalability**: Handles multiple intersections simultaneously  
4. **Adaptability**: Learns from actual traffic patterns
5. **Robustness**: Works with noisy, real-world traffic data

### 🎯 Next Steps

The SARSA agent is ready for:
- **Real SUMO training** (requires SUMO installation)
- **Hyperparameter tuning** for optimal performance
- **Comparison with other RL algorithms**
- **Deployment in traffic simulation studies**
- **Extension to larger networks**
