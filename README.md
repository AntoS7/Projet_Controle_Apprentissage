## SARSA Agent Implementation

### Core SARSA Algorithm
The project implements a complete **SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)** reinforcement learning agent specifically designed for traffic light control:

#### Standard SARSA Agent (`src/environment/sarsa_agent.py`)
- **On-policy Learning**: SARSA uses the actual policy being learned for updates (safer than Q-learning)
- **Temporal Difference**: Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γQ(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
- **Conservative Behavior**: Suitable for traffic control where safety is paramount
- **Multi-intersection Control**: Handles 3 intersections with 4 phases each (64 action combinations)

#### Adaptive SARSA Agent
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks recent episode performance
- **Dynamic Parameter Adjustment**: Automatically adjusts learning rate and exploration
- **Adaptation Trigger**: Modifies parameters when performance stagnates
- **Self-tuning**: Better handling of changing traffic patterns

### State Representation (27 dimensions)
```python
State = [
    # Intersection 1: Queue lengths (4 lanes) + Current phase (4 bits) + Time since change (1)
    queue_north_1, queue_south_1, queue_east_1, queue_west_1,  # Queues (discretized)
    phase_0_1, phase_1_1, phase_2_1, phase_3_1,              # Current phase (one-hot)
    time_since_change_1,                                       # Time (discretized)
    
    # Intersection 2: Same structure
    queue_north_2, queue_south_2, queue_east_2, queue_west_2,
    phase_0_2, phase_1_2, phase_2_2, phase_3_2,
    time_since_change_2,
    
    # Intersection 3: Same structure  
    queue_north_3, queue_south_3, queue_east_3, queue_west_3,
    phase_0_3, phase_1_3, phase_2_3, phase_3_3,
    time_since_change_3
]
```

### Action Space (4³ = 64 combinations)
```python
Action = [intersection_1_phase, intersection_2_phase, intersection_3_phase]
# Each intersection can be in one of 4 phases:
# 0: North-South Green, East-West Red
# 1: North-South Yellow, East-West Red  
# 2: North-South Red, East-West Green
# 3: North-South Red, East-West Yellow
```

### Reward Function
```python
def calculate_reward(self, info):
    # Primary objective: Minimize total queue lengths
    queue_penalty = -sum(queue_lengths)
    
    # Secondary objective: Penalize frequent phase changes
    phase_change_penalty = -0.1 * number_of_phase_changes
    
    # Bonus for maintaining traffic flow
    flow_bonus = 0.1 * vehicles_passed_through
    
    return queue_penalty + phase_change_penalty + flow_bonus
```

### Key Features for Traffic Control

#### 1. Safety-First Approach
- **On-policy Learning**: SARSA learns from the actual policy, avoiding dangerous off-policy exploration
- **Conservative Updates**: Gradual learning prevents erratic traffic light behavior
- **Stable Convergence**: More predictable than Q-learning in safety-critical applications

#### 2. Multi-Intersection Coordination
- **Simultaneous Control**: All 3 intersections controlled as a single coordinated system
- **Global Optimization**: Considers system-wide traffic flow, not just local intersections
- **Scalable Design**: Architecture can extend to larger networks

#### 3. State Discretization
- **Continuous to Discrete**: Converts continuous queue lengths to discrete bins
- **Efficient Q-table**: Manageable state space size for reliable learning
- **Robust Representation**: Handles noisy real-world traffic measurements

#### 4. Exploration Strategy
- **Epsilon-greedy**: Balanced exploration and exploitation
- **Decaying Exploration**: Reduces random actions as agent gains experience
- **Phase-aware Exploration**: Considers traffic safety when exploring actions

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Training
```python
from src.environment.sarsa_agent import SarsaAgent
from src.environment.traffic_env import TrafficEnvironment

# Create environment and agent
env = TrafficEnvironment(use_gui=True)
agent = SarsaAgent(state_size=27, action_size=4)

# Training loop
state, info = env.reset()
action = agent.get_action(state, training=True)

while not done:
    next_state, reward, done, truncated, info = env.step(action)
    
    if done or truncated:
        agent.end_episode(reward)
        break
    else:
        next_action = agent.get_action(next_state, training=True)
        agent.update(reward, next_state, next_action, False)
        state, action = next_state, next_action
```

#### Adaptive Training
```python
from src.environment.sarsa_agent import AdaptiveSarsaAgent

# Create adaptive agent that self-tunes parameters
agent = AdaptiveSarsaAgent(state_size=27, action_size=4)

# The agent automatically adapts learning rate and exploration
# based on recent performance trends
for episode in range(100):
    total_reward = run_episode(agent, env)
    agent.adapt_parameters(total_reward)  # Automatic adaptation
```

### Performance Tracking
The SARSA agent includes comprehensive statistics tracking:
- **Q-table Coverage**: Percentage of state-action pairs explored
- **Epsilon Decay**: Current exploration rate
- **Learning Progress**: Episode rewards and moving averages
- **Action Distribution**: Frequency of different traffic light phases
- **Convergence Metrics**: Q-value stability and policy consistency

## Configuration & Customization

env = TrafficEnvironment(
    sumo_cfg_file="config/simulation.sumocfg",
    use_gui=True,            # Enable/disable GUI
    max_steps=400,           # Maximum steps per episode
    keep_sumo_alive=True,    # Keep SUMO running between episodes
    step_length=1.0,         # Simulation step size (seconds)
    reward_type="queue_based"  # Reward function type
)
```

### Network Customization
Modify network topology by editing configuration files:

#### 1. Edit Intersections (`config/network.nod.xml`)
```xml
<nodes>
    <node id="intersection_1" x="0" y="0" type="traffic_light"/>
    <node id="intersection_2" x="200" y="0" type="traffic_light"/>
    <node id="intersection_3" x="100" y="173" type="traffic_light"/>
</nodes>
```

#### 2. Edit Roads (`config/network.edg.xml`)
```xml
<edges>
    <edge id="road_1_2" from="intersection_1" to="intersection_2" numLanes="2" speed="13.89"/>
    <edge id="road_2_1" from="intersection_2" to="intersection_1" numLanes="2" speed="13.89"/>
</edges>
```

#### 3. Edit Traffic Flows (`config/routes.rou.xml`)
```xml
<routes>
    <flow id="flow_north" route="route_north" begin="0" end="1200" vehsPerHour="400"/>
    <flow id="flow_south" route="route_south" begin="0" end="1200" vehsPerHour="300"/>
</routes>
```

### Training Configuration
Customize training parameters in the main scripts:

```python
# In complete_sumo_training.py or other training scripts
TRAINING_CONFIG = {
    'episodes': 50,              # Number of training episodes
    'max_steps_per_episode': 400,  # Episode length limit
    'save_interval': 10,         # Save model every N episodes
    'evaluation_episodes': 5,    # Episodes for final evaluation
    'visualization_delay': 0.1,  # GUI visualization delay (seconds)
    'statistics_window': 20      # Moving average window for statistics
}
```

## SUMO Integration & Alternatives

### Primary Integration: TraCI
The project primarily uses TraCI (Traffic Control Interface) for real-time communication with SUMO:

```python
import traci

# Start SUMO with TraCI
traci.start(["sumo-gui", "-c", "config/simulation.sumocfg"])

# Control traffic lights in real-time
traci.trafficlight.setPhase("intersection_1", phase_id)

# Get traffic measurements
queue_length = traci.edge.getLastStepHaltingNumber("road_1")
vehicles = traci.vehicle.getIDList()

# Step simulation
traci.simulationStep()
traci.close()
```

### Alternative SUMO Integration Methods

When TraCI has connection issues, the project supports several fallback approaches:

#### 1. Direct Command Line Execution
**Best for**: Batch processing, fastest execution, no real-time control needed

```bash
# Simple direct execution
sumo -c config/simulation.sumocfg --tripinfo-output results.xml

# With comprehensive outputs
sumo -c config/simulation.sumocfg \
     --tripinfo-output tripinfo.xml \
     --summary-output summary.xml \
     --statistic-output statistics.xml
```

**Pros**: ✅ Fastest execution, ✅ No connection issues, ✅ Perfect for batch evaluation
**Cons**: ❌ No real-time control, ❌ Limited interaction

#### 2. LibSUMO (Embedded SUMO)
**Best for**: TraCI-like control with better performance

```python
import libsumo as traci  # Drop-in replacement for traci

# Same API as TraCI but faster (no network overhead)
traci.start(["sumo", "-c", "config/simulation.sumocfg"])
while traci.simulation.getMinExpectedNumber() > 0:
    traci.simulationStep()
traci.close()
```

**Pros**: ✅ Faster than TraCI, ✅ Same API, ✅ Real-time control
**Cons**: ❌ Single simulation per process, ❌ Less stable in some cases

#### 3. Subprocess with Monitoring
**Best for**: Semi-controlled simulations with progress monitoring

```python
import subprocess
import time

cmd = ["sumo", "-c", "config/simulation.sumocfg", "--summary-output", "summary.xml"]
process = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

# Monitor progress
while process.poll() is None:
    print("Simulation running...")
    time.sleep(1)
```

#### 4. Direct SUMO Environment Implementation
The project includes `sumo_direct_env.py` - a custom implementation that:
- Runs SUMO step-by-step without TraCI
- Provides gym-like interface
- Avoids TraCI connection problems
- Suitable for reinforcement learning

### Robust Connection Management
The project implements robust TraCI connection with automatic fallbacks:

```python
def robust_traci_connection(config_file, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            # Kill any existing SUMO processes
            subprocess.run(['pkill', '-f', 'sumo'], stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
            time.sleep(1)
            
            # Start fresh TraCI connection
            traci.start(["sumo-gui", "-c", config_file])
            return True
            
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"TraCI attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {e}")
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                time.sleep(2)
    
    # Fallback to direct SUMO
    print("Falling back to direct SUMO execution")
    return False
```

### Performance Comparison

| Method | Speed | Control | Reliability | Use Case |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------|----------|
| TraCI | 3/5 | 5/5 | 2/5 | Real-time control |
| LibSUMO | 4/5 | 4/5 | 3/5 | Fast RL training |
| Direct CLI | 5/5 | N/A | 5/5 | Batch evaluation |
| Subprocess | 4/5 | 1/5 | 4/5 | Monitoring |
| Direct Env | 3/5 | 3/5 | 4/5 | Reliable RL |

### When to Use Each Method

- **TraCI**: Real-time control experiments (SARSA, MPC) - Primary choice
- **LibSUMO**: High-performance training when TraCI is too slow
- **Direct CLI**: Batch evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, final testing
- **Subprocess**: Development, testing, when you need basic monitoring
- **Direct Env**: Fallback for RL when TraCI has persistent issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Launch Tools Issues
**Problem**: Make command not found or permission denied  
**Solutions:**
```bash
# Install make on macOS
brew install make

# Install make on Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install build-essential

# Make shell script executable
chmod +x launch.sh

# Use shell script as alternative
./launch.sh help
```

#### 2. Enhanced Plot Organization (New!)
**Problem**: Plots saved in wrong directory  
**Solution**: The project automatically saves all plots to `/plots` directory:
```python
# Automatically handled in complete_sumo_training.py
plots_dir = "plots"
os.makedirs(plots_dir, exist_ok=True)
filename = os.path.join(plots_dir, f'sumo_training_{timestamp}.png')
```

**Features:**
- ✅ All plots automatically organized in `/plots` directory
- ✅ Timestamped filenames prevent overwrites
- ✅ Automatic directory creation
- ✅ Compatible with both GUI and headless modes

#### 3. SUMO GUI Episode Management (Enhanced!)
**Problem**: SUMO GUI closes and restarts between episodes  
**Solution**: Enhanced `keep_sumo_alive` functionality now includes:
```python
# Automatic for GUI mode - enhanced features
env = TrafficEnvironment(use_gui=True)  # keep_sumo_alive=True automatically
```

**Enhanced Features:**
- ✅ SUMO window stays open throughout training
- ✅ Faster episode transitions (no startup delay)
- ✅ Press Enter to start episodes automatically  
- ✅ Uninterrupted visual monitoring
- ✅ Manual episode control when desired
- ✅ Professional status updates

#### 4. SUMO Installation Issues
**Problem**: `sumo` command not found  
**Solutions:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install sumo sumo-tools sumo-doc

# macOS with Homebrew (recommended)
brew install sumo

# Windows: Download from https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing/index.html

# Verify installation
sumo --version
sumo-gui --version

# Test with project tools
make test              # Test SUMO installation
./launch.sh test       # Interactive SUMO test
```

#### 5. TraCI Connection Errors
**Problem**: `traci.exceptions.FatalTraCIError`  
**Solutions:**
```python
# Enhanced connection retry logic (already implemented)
# Check if SUMO is running
if traci.isLoaded():
    traci.close()

# Use the project's built-in robust connection
for attempt in range(3):
    try:
        traci.init(port)
        break
    except:
        time.sleep(1)

# Use launch tools for reliable startup
make train-gui         # Automatic robust connection
./launch.sh train-gui  # Interactive with error handling
```

#### 6. Dependency Issues
**Problem**: ImportError for required packages  
**Solution**: Use the automated installation:
```bash
# Using launch tools (recommended)
make install           # Automated dependency installation
./launch.sh install    # Interactive installation with feedback

# Manual installation
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install key packages manually:
pip install numpy matplotlib sumolib traci gymnasium
```

#### 7. Performance Issues
**Problem**: Training is too slow  
**Solutions:**
```bash
# Use fast training modes
make train-fast        # Quick 10-episode training
make demo              # Ultra-fast 2-episode demo
./launch.sh train-fast # Interactive fast training

# Optimize training parameters
python complete_sumo_training.py --fast                    # Built-in fast mode
python complete_sumo_training.py --episodes 10             # Custom episode count
python complete_sumo_training.py --gui --gui-speed 2.0     # 2x speed GUI

# Other optimizations:
# - Use headless mode: make train (instead of make train-gui)
# - Reduce simulation step size in SUMO config
# - Use LibSUMO for faster execution
```

#### 8. Network Configuration Issues
**Problem**: Custom traffic networks not loading  
**Solution**: Use the project's automated network generation:
```bash
# Automatic network setup (recommended)
make setup             # Complete project setup including network generation
./launch.sh setup      # Interactive setup with progress feedback

# Manual verification
make status            # Check if all config files exist
./launch.sh status     # Detailed status with file counts

# Manual network validation
sumo --net-file=config/network.net.xml --route-files=config/routes.rou.xml --begin=0 --end=100

# Regenerate network files
python complete_sumo_training.py  # Automatically regenerates if needed
```

#### 7. Agent Learning Issues
**Problem**: SARSA agent not learning effectively  
**Solutions:**
- **Check exploration**: Verify epsilon is decaying properly
- **Adjust learning rate**: Try different alpha values (0.1-0.5)
- **Monitor Q-table**: Use `agent.print_stats()` to check coverage
- **Increase episodes**: Some networks need more training time

#### 8. GUI Visibility Issues
**Problem**: SUMO GUI not appearing on screen  
**Solution**: Test GUI functionality using demo mode:
```bash
make demo              # Quick GUI test with 2 episodes
./launch.sh demo       # Interactive GUI test with feedback
python complete_sumo_training.py --gui --episodes 2  # Manual GUI test
```
