# SUMO Episode Management Fix

## Problem Solved
The issue where SUMO GUI would close and restart between episodes, making it difficult to observe continuous training.

## Solution Implemented
Added `keep_sumo_alive` parameter to the `TrafficEnvironment` class that:

1. **Prevents SUMO Restart**: When enabled, SUMO stays running between episodes
2. **Smart Reset**: Uses `traci.load()` to reset simulation state without closing SUMO
3. **Fallback Safety**: If reset fails, falls back to full SUMO restart
4. **GUI-Specific**: Automatically enabled in GUI mode for better user experience

## Technical Changes

### 1. TrafficEnvironment Class (`src/environment/traffic_env.py`)
- Added `keep_sumo_alive` parameter to constructor (default: True)
- Modified `reset()` method to check if SUMO restart is needed
- Added `_reset_simulation_state()` method for resetting without closing SUMO
- Updated `reset()` with `force_restart` parameter for manual control

### 2. Training Scripts Updated
- `complete_sumo_training.py`: Added `keep_sumo_alive=use_gui`
- `quick_sumo_training.py`: Added `keep_sumo_alive=use_gui`
- `demo_sumo_gui.py`: Added `keep_sumo_alive=True` for all GUI demos

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- GUI episodes now flow smoothly without window interruption
- Console shows "ðŸ”„ Reset simulation state (SUMO still running)" for episode 2+
- First episode still shows full SUMO startup for transparency
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

## Benefits

âœ… **Smoother GUI Experience**: No more disruptive SUMO window close/restart  
âœ… **Faster Episode Transitions**: Significantly reduced time between episodes in GUI mode  
âœ… **Better for Presentations**: Uninterrupted visual demonstration of learning  
âœ… **Improved Debugging**: Continuous observation of traffic patterns  
âœ… **User-Friendly**: More professional and polished training experience  

## Usage

```python
# Automatic for GUI mode
env = TrafficEnvironment(use_gui=True)  # keep_sumo_alive=True automatically

# Manual control
env = TrafficEnvironment(use_gui=True, keep_sumo_alive=False)  # Force restart each episode

# Force restart on specific episode
state, info = env.reset(force_restart=True)
```

## Verification

Tested with:
- âœ… `python3 demo_sumo_gui.py --fast --episodes 2`
- âœ… `python3 complete_sumo_training.py --gui --episodes 2 --fast`
- âœ… Console output shows proper reset behavior
- âœ… SUMO GUI window stays open between episodes

## Result

The training experience is now significantly improved for GUI mode, providing the smooth, continuous visualization that users expect for monitoring RL agent training progress.
